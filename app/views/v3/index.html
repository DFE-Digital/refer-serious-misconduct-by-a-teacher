      <p>Before you report a teacher, you should complain to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the school or sixth form college</li>
        <li>the board of governors</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">your local council</a></li>
      </ul>

      <!--  <p>If you’re not satisfied with the result, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/complain-to-dfe">complain to the Department for Education</a>.</p> -->

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/teaching-regulation-agency">Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA)</a> only investigates misconduct if it's serious enough for the teacher to be prevented from teaching again.      </div>

      <p>Examples of serious misconduct include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>sexual misconduct</li>
        <li>violent behaviour</li>
        <li>serious failure to protect the safety and wellbeing of pupils</li>
        <li>alcohol or drug misuse</li>
        <li>fraud or serious dishonesty</li>
        <li>discrimination or harassment</li>
        <li>promoting extreme political or religious views</li>
        <li>serious criminal offences</li>
      </ul>
    
      
      <h2 id="before-you-start" class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
      <p>You’ll need to provide:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your contact details and information about the teacher you are reporting</li>
      <li>evidence to support your allegation, for example signed witness statements or previous complaints against the teacher</li>   
      </ul>
      <p>You should allow an hour or more to complete your referral. The time it will take depends on the case. It will be faster if you’ve prepared the evidence.</p>

      <p>Once you've signed in, you'll be able to save your answers and come back later to complete the referral.</p>
