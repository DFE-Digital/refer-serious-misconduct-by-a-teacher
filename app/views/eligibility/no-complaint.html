      <p>Before referring a teacher, first consider making a complaint to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          the school
        </li>
        <li>
          the school governors
        </li>
        <li>
          your local council
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>View guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-teacher-misconduct">how to make an informal complaint</a>.</p>

      <p>You can still refer a teacher without making an informal complaint. Your allegation may not be investigated unless you have made a complaint first.</p>
