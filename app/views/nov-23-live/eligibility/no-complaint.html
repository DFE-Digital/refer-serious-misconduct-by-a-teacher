      <p>Follow these steps to make a complaint:</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        1. Contact the school to make an informal complaint
      </h2>

      <p>You can make an informal complaint. The school will tell you when they will respond.</p>
      <p>After the school reviews your complaint, you’ll be told the outcome.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        2. Contact the school to make a formal complaint
      </h2>

      <p>If the problem is not resolved, follow the school’s complaints process to make a formal complaint.</p>

      <p>Every school in England must have a complaints policy. It’s usually available on the school’s website or from the school office. It should tell you the kind of complaints the school deals with.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        3. Contact the board of governors or your local council
      </h2>

      <p>If you’re not satisfied with how the school has handled your complaint, contact the board of governors or your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">local council</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        4. Make a complaint to the Department for Education (DfE)
      </h2>

      <p>If you’re still not satisfied with how the school dealt with your complaint, you can make a complaint to the DfE.</p>

      <p>DfE will only consider your complaint if either of the following apply:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          you have completed the school’s complaints process
        </li>
        <li>
          you have been stopped from completing the school’s complaints process
        </li>
      </ul>

      {{ govukButton({
        text: "Make a complaint",
        href: "https://www.gov.uk/complain-to-dfe"
