    <p>Your referral will usually be reviewed within 3 working days. It may be longer if more information is needed.</p>

    <p>It could be decided that:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the case will not be investigated, for example because it’s unlikely the teacher will be stopped from teaching</li>
      <li>a formal investigation will be launched</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You’ll be sent an email with the decision.</p>
