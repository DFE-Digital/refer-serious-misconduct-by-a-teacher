      <p>Your case will only be investigated if the misconduct is serious enough to potentially result in a teacher being stopped from teaching (known as a ‘prohibition order’).</p>

      <p>You should provide any evidence to support your allegation, for example signed witness statements or previous complaints against the teacher.</p>

      <p>All cases of incompetence and less serious misconduct should be dealt with by employers.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long it will take to complete your referral</h2>

      <p>You should allow an hour or more to complete your referral. The time it will take depends on the case. It will be faster if you’ve prepared the evidence.</p>
