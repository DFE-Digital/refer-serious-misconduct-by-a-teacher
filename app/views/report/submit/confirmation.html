    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

    <p>Your referral will be reviewed within 3 working days.</p>

    <p>It can take up to 20 weeks from the date of your referral for TRA to make a decision whether to investigate your case.</p>

    <p>If a decision is not made within 14 days of receiving your referral, you’ll be sent an email to let you know.</p>

    <p>TRA could decide that they:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>need more information</li>
      <li>will not investigate the case, for example because it’s unlikely to result in a prohibition order</li>
      <li>will launch a formal investigation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contact TRA about this referral</h2>
