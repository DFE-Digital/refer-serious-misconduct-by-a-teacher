    <p>The TRA could decide that:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>more information is needed</li>
      <li>the case will not be investigated, for example because it’s unlikely the teacher will be stopped from teaching</li>
      <li>a formal investigation will be launched</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You’ll be sent an email with the decision within 20 weeks.</p>
